# Say hello to Archie!
### Who is Archie?
Archie is our official and main CAD discord bot. It can do a lot of things for you, like look for the weather, roll a dice or just talk with you! All content is published in GitHub.
### How it's programmed?
Archie is programmed in Python because we consider that it's easier than C++ and more effective than javascript. Most of discord bots are in this programming language. We recommend you to run it in Python 3.6.6.
### Which file should be used?
The main functional code is in one file: "archie_official.py", but there are also others like "botversion.py", which has the version information.
### Is Archie public?
Archie is now public. You can talk to it via DM, on our discord server or you can add it to your own server with this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=462272072236793856&scope=bot&permissions=8.
